  1) To commence my career as a full-stack developer outside of my schooling,
  2) To offer a simple application for the good of others, that someone might
  be inspired by a simple thing and even build off of this random psalm generator,
  for the greater glory of God.
  Whatever comes of it, may it be but a small benefit, and inevitably aid in
  returning every user away from alluring screens towards the Creator of all things,
  the most intelligent and imaginative, God.
  God bless you.`,
