            3 he restores my soul. He leads me in paths of righteousness for his
            name’s sake.<br />
            4 Even though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death, I
            fear no evil; for thou art with me; thy rod and thy staff, they
            comfort me.<br />
            5 Thou preparest a table before me in the presence of my enemies;
            thou anointest my head with oil, my cup overflows.<br />
            6 Surely goodness and mercy shall follow me all the days of my life;
            and I shall dwell in the house of the Lord for ever.`,

  1. To commence my career as a full-stack developer outside of my schooling,<br />

  be inspired by a simple thing and even build off of this random psalm generator,<br />
  for the greater glory of God.<br />

  returning every user away from alluring screens towards the Creator of all things,<br />
  the most intelligent and imaginative, God.<br />
